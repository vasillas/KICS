### Voice Pack for Elite Dangerous oringinally by Arflint. Now Maintained by the community 

   This is a Voice Pack for [Voice Attack](https://www.voiceattack.com/) 

## NOTE
 i am not the original creator of this voicepack, but i quickly grew to love using it with Elite: Dangerous, even though it's original author had long since left it behind and ceded all rights to the community*, the only problem i had with it were a few non working commands and the keybindings, i plan to slowly update this fork to support bindED to make life easier for anyone wishing to use this voice pack, i may add new commands and edit others as well, but new voice responses cannot be created so im limited in what i can do

## Status

Currently updating to support bindED plugin as of 6th of april 2018
